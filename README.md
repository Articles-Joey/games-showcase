# Games Showcase

![Preview](/public/img/preview.webp)

A 3D collection of games I developed, this serves as a portfolio/another 3D example project/game launcher.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Roadmap

- Add Electron
- Epic Games Artwork
- Additional Steam and Epic game features data
- IGDB API Relay?
- Dashboard for adding custom games/game scenes

## Game Store Support

One of the features on top of just a showcase of the Articles Media games is that this can be used to showcase your own pc game collection. Manually add games via json or add your game library locations to see them in the launcher.

| Store |  Status  | Details |
|:-----|:--------:|------:|
| Steam   | 🏗️ | Almost complete, can fetch games and artwork but metadata needs some sort of API. Game launching possible but not implemented yet. |
| Epic Games   |  ⚠️  | Games can be fetched but not artwork or metadata at the moment. |
| GOG Galaxy   | 🗺️ |    Planned/Unexplored |
| Xbox   | 🗺️ |    Planned/Unexplored |
| EA   | 🗺️ |    Planned/Unexplored |
| Battle.net   | 🗺️ |    Planned/Unexplored |
| Ubisoft Connect   | 🗺️ |    Planned/Unexplored |
